## Overview
In this lab, we will learn how to setup an environment to start developing Machine Learning (ML) Solutions on Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) service with native modules, R and Python scripts. Microsoft Azure ML is a cloud service that has ready to use templates, APIs as a solution to various problems such as fraud, anomaly detection, sentiment analysis, face recognition etc. Along with these APIs, it is also possible to develop custom solutions with custom algorithms even by integrating custom R or Python scripts.  

Azure ML is a subscription based online service that can be accessed through a regular web browser. It provides [guest, free and standard tier services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning?view=azureml-api-2). With some limitations, guest access doesnâ€™t require any login process. With few clicks, without an account, you can start to develop ML solutions. Other tiers require a Microsoft account and we will develop most of our experiments, R and Python scripts on free or standard tier environment. Main difference between the free and the standard account is the performance. Free account has resource limitation which will result in low performance, low execution speed in experiments. To have a general knowledge on other platforms, we will also setup R and Python app development environments.

### Objectives
This lab will show you how to:
* Setup free Microsoft Azure ML workspace
* Setup Azure ML workspace within an existing Azure subscription
* Setup Python development environment
* Setup R development environment
