## Overview
In this lab, we will learn how to set up an environment to start developing Machine Learning (ML) solutions on Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) service. Microsoft Azure ML is a cloud service that provides ready-to-use templates and APIs as a solution to various problems such as fraud, anomaly detection, sentiment analysis, face recognition, etc. Along with these APIs, it is also possible to develop custom solutions with custom algorithms even by integrating custom R or Python scripts. Azure ML is a subscription-based online service that can be accessed through a regular web browser.
